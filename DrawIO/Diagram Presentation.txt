Diagram Presentation 

Date: Oct 4, 2017
Total Time: 30-45 min

Tools: draw.io, confluence, balsamiq

Goal: 

	1. Why this is useful
	2. Introduce Draw.IO, Balsamiq, and Confluence
	3. Review UML
	4. Tie everything together with a real project


======

PART 1: WHY THIS IS USEFUL

	1. Introduction

		Measure twice, cut once. An old adage but extremely applicable in this field. As projects become more complex, planning becomes more important


	2. Why do this?

		Documentation is boring. 

		Planning is critical

		Visual learning is better than having to read a wall of text (use cooking infographic comparison)

		Being able to visualize the problem overall makes it easy to identify issues early on

		Ultimately saves time

		Everyone generally has a different idea on how to approach a problem. Can help bring cohesion to a soltuion when working on a team
 
		Makes life easier for whoever continues a project after you

		Makes life easier for those joining a team in the middle of the project

PART 2: TOOLS

	1. Introduction

		Going to introduce two different tools that correspond to different parts of planning

		All of these plug into Confluence

		All of these are relatively well known

	2. Tool 1: Balsamiq

		Balsamiq is a tool for mocking up graphical user interfaces

		Most of what we do now has moved to involving web and mobile in some way

		Widely adopted

		Better than a white board

		Can emphasize dynamic elements

		Produces a very clear picture of the end goal

		Able to easily send this to the client and get feedback

		Ultimately saves time


	3. Tool 2: Draw.IO

		Visual planning: UML, Network Diagrams, Data Diagrams, etc.

		Confluence plugin available

		Can easily tie into many accounts you already have

		Built in HTML5

		Clean and easy to use interface

		Free


	4. Tool Alternatives:

		MS Visio - Set the standard early on for this. Professional tool w/ some nice features. Paid.

		LucidChart - Allegedly the most popular online tool
